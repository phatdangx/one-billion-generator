# One Billion Generator

## Description

This repository hosts a programming challenge that aims to generate a text file containing from 1 to 1 billion lines, with the objective of finding the program with the smallest runtime. The challenge encourages participants to create efficient algorithms and explore optimizations to generate the text file as quickly as possible.

## Challenge Details

The challenge involves writing a program that can generate a text file with the following specifications:

- The text file should consist of a specific number of lines, ranging from 1 to 1 billion.
- Each line should contain a unique number
- The program should output the generated text file to the local filesystem

## Getting Started

To participate in the challenge, follow these steps:

1. Fork this repository to have your own copy.
2. Implement your program in the programming language of your choice.
3. Provide clear instructions on how to run your program, including any dependencies.
4. Ensure that your program generates the text file as per the challenge specifications.
5. Document any assumptions or limitations of your program.
6. Commit and push your code to your forked repository.

## Submission Guidelines

To submit your entry, create a pull request from your forked repository to this main repository. In your pull request, include the following information:

1. Name or username.
2. Description of your approach, including any optimizations or techniques used.
3. Any additional notes or insights gained during the challenge.
4. Runtime benchmark (if available) or any performance-related details.

## Evaluation Criteria

The submissions will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

1. **Runtime Efficiency:** The primary evaluation metric is the runtime of the program. The program with the smallest runtime will be the winner.
2. **Code Quality:** The clarity, organization, and readability of the code will be taken into consideration.

## Rules and Notes

1. The challenge is open to participants of all skill levels. It aims to promote learning, creativity, and the exploration of efficient algorithms.
2. Plagiarism or copying others' solutions is strictly prohibited. Please respect the spirit of the challenge and provide original work.
3. Any programming language can be used for the challenge.
4. While optimizations and parallelization techniques are encouraged, the use of specialized hardware (e.g., GPU, FPGA) is not allowed.
5. The challenge organizers reserve the right to disqualify any submission that violates the rules or fails to meet the challenge criteria.

## Disclaimer

The challenge organizers and contributors are not responsible for any damages or liabilities caused by the participants' programs. Participants are solely responsible for their own code and any consequences that arise from running their programs.

## Contributing

If you have any suggestions, improvements, or feature requests, please create an issue or a pull request. Contributions are always welcome!
